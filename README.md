# TokenizingControlTester
This is a Tokenizing control for WPF apps. 
This project is forked from project done by Pava Podila ([@pavanpodila](https://twitter.com/pavanpodila)) and originally published on [Pixel-In-Gene Blog](https://blog.pixelingene.com/2010/10/tokenizing-control-convert-text-to-tokens/) post. 

I needed some extra features such as extracting tags and having special designed tags so I decided to share my solution. Enjoy using it and kudos to Pavan for publishing it with an extensive instructions how to make yourown.
